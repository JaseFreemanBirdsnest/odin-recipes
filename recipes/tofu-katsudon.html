    <h1>Tofu Katsudon</h1>

        <p>Tofu Katsudon is a vegetarian version of one of my favourite Japanese dishes. 
        Firm tofu "Steaks" are breaded and fried. The sauce is a sweet and savory mix 
        of Soy, Sake, and dashi, with onions softened and then beaten egg poured over top. </p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Firm Tofu</li>
        <li>Japanes rice</li>
        <li>Eggs for breading (depends on how many katsu you're making)</li>
        <li>Eggs for pouring over (2 eggs per person)</li>
        <li>Panko Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Plain Flour</li>
        <li>Onion (1/2 a large onion per person)</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Sake</li>
        <li>Mirin</li>
        <li>Dashi</li>
        <li>Oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
    
    <h2>How to prepare</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook your rice as per the packet instructions or according to your rice cookers instructions</li>
        <li>Remove the tofu from the packet, wrap in paper towel, and press under a heavy pot filled with water. This helps to remove some of the water held in the tofu.</li>
        <li>While the tofu is pressing, cut the onion in half, then slice the onion north to south. Slicing the onion this way means that it will hold its shape better when cooked.</li>
        <li>Combine the Soy, Sake, Mirin, and Dashi and set aside.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with the Plain Flour, beaten eggs, and Panko.</li>
        <li>Remove the tofu from its pressing and slice into 1cm thick "steaks". Bread each of the steaks, flour to egg to breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Shallow fry the Tofu katsu's and set aside on a wire rack. using the wire rack will prevent to bottom of the katsu becoming soggy</li>
        <li>In a small frypan heat some cooking oil over medium high heat, add in 1 portion of the onion, saute until slightly softened. If you have multiple small frypans you can do more at once.</li>
        <li>Once the onion is softened add in approx 150ml of the Dashi mixture and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile slice each Katsu into 2cm strips</li>
        <li>When the Dashi mixture is at a simmer, place one of the sliced Katsu ontop of the onions and Dashi, then pour over the 2 beaten eggs. Cover and allow to cook. Be careful not to overcook the eggs as they will develop an unpleasent texture</li>
        <li>While the eggs are cooking, portion the rice out. To stop the rice going cold only portion as many as you have fry pans. </li>
        <li>When the eggs are finished cooking, Slide /  pour the entire contents of the frypan over a portion of rice and serve</li>
    </ol>
